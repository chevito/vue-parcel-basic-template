# Vue template with Parcel

This is a basic Vue template which already includes some of the common libraries used along. It was created to save some time during project initialization. 

### Tech

This template includes the next libraries to work with:

* [Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/) - Vue Router is the official router for Vue.js
* [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) - Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. 
* [Buefy](https://buefy.org/) - Lightweight UI components for Vue.js based on Bulma
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler
* [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) - The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript 


Also, the overall project structure is based in the layout proposed in the article [Organize Vue.js Application and Make It Scale (life in vue js)](https://medium.com/@channasmcs/organize-vue-js-application-and-make-it-scale-life-in-vue-js-28a40cb94dfe). Read that if you have questions about the folder naming and use.

### Installation

The template requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Also it requires the [vue cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm install -g @vue/cli
# OR
yarn global add @vue/cli
# Then
vue init chevito/vue-parcel-basic-template sample-app
```
